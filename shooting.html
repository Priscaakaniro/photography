<h1 id="txt">shooting in RAW</h1>
<div class="raw"> </div>

<div class="content"><p>
    When taking a picture with a digital camera, you can either shoot in manual (raw format) or auto mode (jpeg format).
    When shooting in auto, the camera automatically decides what the appropriate settings would be before you take the shot. <br>
    When shooting in raw on the other hand, the camera is in manual mode, <br>
    and you have to decide the level of light you want to include in your picture,<br>
    how fast you want the picture taken, basically, you must
    set everything up yourself based on how you want the final picture to look like.<br><br>
    <b>What is RAW?</b>
    Raw images are large and uncompressed files that keep all the details of your shot. 
    Shooting a picture in raw gives you (the photographer) 
    the liberty to edit to your taste as it offers a great amount of details on the image(s) you shoot.<br><br></p></div>
    <div class="rest"><p class="camera">
    The 3 main camera settings you need to implement when shooting in raw are:<br>
    <b>Aperture:</b> this means the opening of the camera lens.
    It affects directly, the amount of light entering your photo. <br>
    This setting determines the exposure of the photo, its depth of field, sharpness and overall final look of the picture.<br><br>
    <b>ISO:</b> this also is influenced by light. It increases the level of light information captured by the camera sensor (noise level).<br><br>
    <b>Shutter speed:</b> measured in seconds, is the length of time the camera is open and capturing light.<br>
    It is directly affected by motion and steadiness, so consider using a tripod when shooting your pictures, for a steady photo. <br></p>
