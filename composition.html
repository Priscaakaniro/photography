<h1 id="txt">Composition in photography</h1>
<div class="monique"> </div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Composition in simple terms, means the constituents of your photo. <br>It is basically what made up the shot you took.<br>
    The items in the picture, people, the arrangement of the elements in the picture, all pieced together, make up the composition of the picture.<br>
    Your composition strongly determines the quality of your picture.
    When you have a very good composition, it certainly leads to a great picture
    and the reverse is the case.<br></p></div>

    <div class="rest"> <p class="composition">
    When deciding the composition of your picture, keep in mind that simple setups thrive more than complicated set ups.
    <!--about less is more-->
    An architect designer called <b><em><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
    </a></em></b> is often associated with the saying <b>“less is more”</b>from
   <b><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43745/andrea-del-sarto">Andrea del Sarto</a></b>, 1855, 
    a poem by <b><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning">Robert Browning</a></b>
    which basically suggests that the simpler, the better.<br>
    It is a great quote to live buy especially in art related things and areas, and your photography is your art.<br></p>

<h1>Position and angles</h1> </div>
<p class="explanation"> The position and angles are two elements that has great impact on the outcome of your shots.<br>
    There are 3 main types of position and angles, which we would discuss in a bit. <br>
    First, what is the definition of position and angles in relation to photography? <br></p>

<div class="content">
<p>
        <b>Position</b> in simple terms refer to the height the camera is held from in relation to the ground.
        The position you choose to shoot your subject from greatly influences the outcome.<br><br>
        There are 3 basic positions to keep in mind when making your composition, they are:<br>
        <b>Eye-level position:</b> this means holding the camera at a position normal to your eye.<br><br>
        <b>High position:</b> this means holding the camera at a position higher than your eye-level.
        You can achieve this position by raising your arms or with the aid of a higher platform, like a foot stool or crate.<br>
        <br><b>Low position:</b> this means holding the camera at a position lower than your eye-level.
        This position can be achieved by squatting or lying down or simply bringing your arms lower than your eye-level.<br></p>

    </div>
     
<div class="rest">
        <p class="angles"> <b>Angles</b> are basically the degree from which the camera is pointing to the subject. 
        As much as having a clear subject would help you achieve a clear and good shot, 
        shooting from the correct angle and position would help enhance the quality of the shot. <br><br>
        There are 3 basic angles to keep in mind when making your composition, they are:<br>
        <b>Eye-level angle:</b> this means holding the camera at a horizontal level.<br><br>
        <b>High angle:</b> this means holding the camera in a way that makes the camera face downwards.<br><br>
        <b>Low angle:</b> this means holding the camera in a way that makes the camera face upwards.<br></p>
