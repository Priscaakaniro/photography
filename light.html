<h1 id="txt">Concept of Light</h1>
<div class="oghale"> </div>

<div class="content"><p>
    The concept of light in photography refers to how the light source is positioned relative to your subject or vice versa.
    There are two major types of light that comes into play when taking a picture.
    They are <b>natural light</b> and <b>artificial light</b>.<br><br>
    Natural light simply means the light from the sky, while artificial light refers to light sources made by someone. <br> 
    It is easier to tweak artificial lights on photography than natural light,
    but both types of lights achieve the same goal when used properly.
    The type of light you use or how you use light, is the most important element in any photo you take. <br><br> 
    Imagine a photo where the subject is backing light source,
    the subject would be dark, and all you will see is a dark silhouette of the subject. <br></p></div>

    <div class="rest"><p class="light">
    Except that is what you are going for, it would not showcase your subject,
    which defeats the entire purpose.
    To correct that, position your subject to either face the light source or stay in such a way the light shines on the subject.<br>
    <br>The position and quality of your light source affects a lot of things in your final photo,<br>
    from the clarity of the picture to the tone to the emotion being captured in the picture and so much more. <br>
    <br>Depending on the mood you are going for in a picture,
    you need to pay attention to the effect of light on your subject.
    When you can harness light to your favour, you will be a very good photographer.<br></p>
